License\-: Modified B\-S\-D Please see the file L\-I\-C\-E\-N\-S\-E.\-R\-S\-T\-M for licensing information S\-T\-A\-M\-P does some odd things with function pointers, which makes g++ unhappy and makes it very hard to reason about the correctness of code. The most offensive is that S\-T\-A\-M\-P may coerce a function pointer for a 3-\/argument comparison function into a 2-\/argument comparison function.

We avoid this situation by saying that rather than store a function pointer within a collection's root node, we'll store a pointer to a struct, where the struct has two function pointers\-: one for transactional code, one for nontransactional code, with 3 and 2 parameters, respectively. This adds a level of indirection (though only once per collection traversal, if we are careful), but increases safety and allows better reasoning.
