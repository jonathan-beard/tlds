# TLDS

TLDS provides a framework for developing transactional containers from lock-free ones.
Lock-free algorithms guarantee that the system makes progress in a finite number of steps, regardless of the system scheduler or actions of other threads.
TLDS includes two examples of transactional data structures, a lock-free linked list and a lock-free skip list. We are currently working on supporting transactional data structures for non-linked containers and also transactions that are executed on multiple containers.
